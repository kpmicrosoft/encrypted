#### R3dPdn@

* Created initial project
* installed Tailwinds CSS and Material UI for styling
* Created Button, Header, and Footer components
* Added React Routing
* Created base page components
* Created the landing page

#### Summary: I added the basics of the website. I've got the routing working and crated the basic components we'll need to create the UI. I would like to reuse our components as much as possible. To that end, if we create any basic components please add them to the common directory

#### I've added both React Material components as well as Tailwind. These are both powerful CSS libraries we should be able to leverage to quickly make functional layouts. If you could work on establishing a color scheme and prettying up the UI that would be great. We also need to get the connection to the API

#### I added the service for reaching out to the API. This is basically first functional element we need to establish for the project
